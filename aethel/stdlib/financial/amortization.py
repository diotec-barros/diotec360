    """
    Calculate fixed monthly payment for loan (amortizing loan formula)
    
    Args:
        principal: Loan amount (in cents)
        annual_rate_bps: Annual interest rate in basis points (500 = 5%)
        months: Loan term in months
    
    Returns:
        PaymentResult with monthly payment and proof
    
    Mathematical Proof:
        Formula: M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
        Where:
        - M = monthly payment
        - P = principal
        - r = monthly interest rate
        - n = number of months
        
        Derivation:
        Present value of annuity formula:
        PV = M × [(1 - (1+r)^(-n)) / r]
        
        Solving for M:
        M = PV × r / [1 - (1+r)^(-n)]
        M = P × r / [1 - 1/(1+r)^n]
        M = P × r × (1+r)^n / [(1+r)^n - 1]
        
        Properties:
        1. M > 0 (payment must be positive)
        2. M × n >= P (total payments cover principal)
        3. M decreases as n increases (longer term = lower payment)
        4. M increases as r increases (higher rate = higher payment)
