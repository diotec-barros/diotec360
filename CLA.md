# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Aethel Protocol**  
**DIOTEC 360**

## Purpose

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to DIOTEC 360. This is a legally binding document, so please read it carefully before agreeing to it.

## Agreement

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to DIOTEC 360. Except for the license granted herein to DIOTEC 360 and recipients of software distributed by DIOTEC 360, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

## Definitions

**"You"** (or **"Your"**) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with DIOTEC 360.

**"Contribution"** shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to DIOTEC 360 for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by DIOTEC 360 (the "Work").

**"Submit"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to DIOTEC 360 or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems.

## Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to DIOTEC 360 and to recipients of software distributed by DIOTEC 360 a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

## Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to DIOTEC 360 and to recipients of software distributed by DIOTEC 360 a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## Representations

You represent that:

1. You are legally entitled to grant the above license.

2. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to DIOTEC 360, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with DIOTEC 360.

3. Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).

4. Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

## Notification

You agree to notify DIOTEC 360 of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

## Third-Party Works

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to DIOTEC 360 separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

## Support

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## Future Changes

You understand that DIOTEC 360 is not obligated to use Your Contribution as part of the Work and may decide to include any Contribution DIOTEC 360 considers appropriate.

You understand that the decision to include the Contribution in any project or source repository is entirely that of DIOTEC 360, and this agreement does not guarantee that the Contributions will be included in any product.

## Disclaimer

EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 4, THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO DIOTEC 360 AND BY DIOTEC 360 TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.

## Consequential Damage Waiver

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR DIOTEC 360 BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.

## Miscellaneous

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Portugal excluding its conflicts of law provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in this section might be superseded by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("UN Convention") and the parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to this Agreement and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention in its entirety to this Agreement.
