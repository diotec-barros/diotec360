# Feature Matrix: Open Source vs Commercial

## Overview

Aethel follows an **open core** model: the complete protocol, language, and runtime are open source and free to use. Commercial offerings provide managed infrastructure, expert support, and certification that enable enterprise adoption at scale.

This document transparently explains what's open source and what's commercial, helping you make informed decisions about your Aethel deployment.

## Philosophy: Trust Through Transparency

**Our Commitment**:
- The Core Diotec360 protocol is and will always be open source
- No "crippled" open source version - you get the full protocol
- Commercial offerings add operational value, not technical features
- Clear separation between protocol and services

**Why Open Core?**

We believe financial infrastructure should be:
- **Auditable**: Anyone can inspect the code for security and correctness
- **Trustworthy**: No hidden backdoors or proprietary black boxes
- **Eternal**: The protocol outlives any single company
- **Accessible**: Anyone can use, modify, and deploy Aethel

We also believe sustainable development requires revenue:
- **Quality**: Full-time engineers ensure security and reliability
- **Innovation**: Funding enables advanced features like Proof-of-Proof consensus
- **Support**: Expert assistance for mission-critical deployments
- **Ecosystem**: Investment in tools, documentation, and community

## Monetization Model Explained

### What's Open Source (Free Forever)

**The Protocol**: The complete Aethel language, compiler, runtime, and consensus protocol are open source under Apache 2.0 license. This includes:
- All mathematical proof capabilities
- All conservation laws and security features
- All AI and intelligence capabilities
- All consensus and networking features
- Complete source code with no limitations

**Why?** We believe financial infrastructure should be transparent, auditable, and eternal. The protocol is a public good.

### What's Commercial (Paid Services)

- Custom development for unique requirements
- Training and certification programs

**Certification**: Official validation provides competitive advantage:
- Implementation certification for deployments
- Developer certification for individuals
- Architect certification for experts
- Listed in official certified directory

**Why?** These services require significant ongoing investment in people, infrastructure, and expertise. Revenue enables us to:
- Employ full-time engineers to maintain and improve Aethel
- Provide world-class support for enterprise customers

## Decision Guide

### Choose Open Source (Self-Hosted) If:

✅ You're developing or testing  
✅ You have DevOps expertise  
✅ You can manage infrastructure yourself  
✅ You don't need guaranteed SLAs  
✅ You want full control over deployment  
✅ You're cost-sensitive and have time to invest  

**Example**: Startup building proof-of-concept, developer learning Aethel, research project

### Choose Commercial (Managed + Support) If:

✅ You're running production financial systems  
✅ You need guaranteed uptime and response times  
✅ You lack DevOps resources  
✅ You need compliance certifications  
✅ You want to focus on your application, not infrastructure  
✅ You need expert guidance and support  

**Example**: Bank deploying payment system, fintech launching DeFi protocol, enterprise with compliance requirements

### Hybrid Approach

Many organizations use both:
- **Development**: Self-hosted open source
- **Staging**: Managed hosting (Professional tier)
- **Production**: Managed hosting (Enterprise tier) + Enterprise Support

This provides cost-effective development while ensuring production reliability.
