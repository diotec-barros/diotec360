# Implementation Plan: Autonomous Sentinel

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the Autonomous Sentinel v1.9.0 into discrete coding tasks. The system transforms Aethel from a passive fortress into an autonomous self-protecting entity with 7 core components: Sentinel Monitor, Semantic Sanitizer, Adaptive Rigor, Quarantine System, Self-Healing Engine, Adversarial Vaccine, and Gauntlet Report.

Implementation follows a bottom-up approach: core telemetry and detection first, then adaptive defense, then learning capabilities, and finally integration and testing.
