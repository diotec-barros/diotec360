# MOE Intelligence Layer Rollback Plan

## Overview

This document provides procedures for rolling back the MOE Intelligence Layer v2.1.0 to v1.9.0 behavior (existing layers only) in case of critical issues. The rollback is designed to be fast (<5 minutes) and safe (no data loss).

## When to Rollback

Execute rollback if any of the following occur:

### Critical Conditions (Immediate Rollback)
- Expert accuracy <99.9% for more than 10 minutes
- False positive rate >1% for more than 10 minutes
- MOE orchestration overhead >10ms for more than 5 minutes
- System throughput <1000 tx/s for more than 5 minutes
- Expert failure rate >5% for more than 5 minutes
- Consensus engine producing incorrect verdicts
- Database corruption or data loss
- Security vulnerability discovered in MOE components

### Warning Conditions (Consider Rollback)
- Expert accuracy <99.95% for more than 30 minutes
- False positive rate >0.5% for more than 30 minutes
- MOE orchestration overhead >5ms for more than 15 minutes
- Expert failure rate >2% for more than 15 minutes
- Uncertainty rate >1% for more than 30 minutes
- Fallback rate >10% for more than 30 minutes

## Rollback Procedure

### Phase 1: Immediate Disable (< 1 minute)

**Step 1: Disable MOE via Environment Variable**

```bash
# Set environment variable to disable MOE
export AETHEL_MOE_ENABLED=false

# Or update configuration file
echo "AETHEL_MOE_ENABLED=false" >> .env

# Restart application
systemctl restart aethel-judge
# OR
docker-compose restart
# OR
kill -HUP $(cat aethel.pid)
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- MOE Orchestrator: DISABLED
- All Experts: DISABLED (Z3, Sentinel, Guardian)
- Gating Network: DISABLED
- Consensus Engine: DISABLED
- Verdict Caching: DISABLED
- Expert Training: DISABLED
- **Fallback**: System operates with v1.9.0 Layers -1 to 4 only

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check logs for rollback confirmation
tail -f logs/aethel.log | grep "MOE disabled"

# Verify v1.9.0 behavior
curl -X POST http://localhost:7860/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code": "transfer(alice, bob, 100)"}'

# Should see: "MOE: DISABLED" in response headers
```

### Phase 2: Validate Rollback (< 2 minutes)

**Step 2: Run Rollback Tests**

```bash
# Execute rollback test suite
python scripts/test_moe_rollback.py

# Expected output:
# ✅ MOE disabled
# ✅ Existing layers operational (Layers -1 to 4)
# ✅ Throughput restored
# ✅ No MOE overhead
# ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
```

**Step 3: Monitor System Health**

```bash
# Monitor for 2 minutes
python scripts/monitor_system.py --duration 120

# Check metrics:
# - Throughput should return to v1.9.0 levels
# - MOE overhead should drop to 0ms
# - False positive rate should match v1.9.0 baseline
# - All existing layers operational
```

### Phase 3: Preserve Data (< 2 minutes)

**Step 4: Backup MOE Databases**

```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p ./backups/moe_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Backup telemetry database
cp ./.aethel_moe/telemetry.db ./backups/moe_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/telemetry.db

# Backup training database
cp ./.aethel_moe/training.db ./backups/moe_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/training.db

# Backup configuration
cp ./config/moe_*.env ./backups/moe_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/
```

**Step 5: Export Reports for Analysis**

```bash
# Export expert performance report
python scripts/export_moe_report.py \
  --format pdf \
  --output ./reports/moe_rollback_analysis_$(date +%Y%m%d).pdf

# Export telemetry statistics
python scripts/export_moe_telemetry.py \
  --format json \
  --output ./reports/moe_telemetry_$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Export training data
python scripts/export_moe_training.py \
  --format csv \
  --output ./reports/moe_training_$(date +%Y%m%d).csv
```

## Fallback Behavior

When MOE is disabled, the system operates with v1.9.0 behavior:

### Active Components (v1.9.0)
- ✅ Layer -1: Semantic Sanitizer
- ✅ Layer 0: Input Sanitizer
- ✅ Layer 1: Conservation Checker
- ✅ Layer 2: Overflow Detector
- ✅ Layer 3: Z3 Formal Verifier
- ✅ Layer 4: ZKP Privacy Layer
- ✅ Sentinel Monitor
- ✅ Crisis Mode
- ✅ Quarantine System
- ✅ Self-Healing Engine
- ✅ Adversarial Vaccine
- ✅ Synchrony Protocol

### Disabled Components (v2.1.0)
- ❌ MOE Orchestrator
- ❌ Z3 Expert
- ❌ Sentinel Expert
- ❌ Guardian Expert
- ❌ Gating Network
- ❌ Consensus Engine
- ❌ Verdict Caching
- ❌ Expert Training
- ❌ Visual Dashboard (MOE-specific)

### Performance Impact
- Throughput: Returns to v1.9.0 baseline
- Overhead: MOE overhead (10ms) removed
- Latency: Returns to v1.9.0 baseline
- Accuracy: Returns to v1.9.0 baseline (99.9%+)

### Security Impact
- Still protected by all v1.9.0 layers (Layers -1 to 4)
- No expert consensus (single-agent verification)
- No parallel expert execution
- No expert-specific optimizations

## Rollback Testing Checklist

Before declaring rollback complete, verify:

- [ ] MOE disabled (check logs)
- [ ] All v1.9.0 layers operational (run test suite)
- [ ] Throughput restored to v1.9.0 levels
- [ ] MOE overhead reduced to 0ms
- [ ] False positive rate matches v1.9.0 baseline
- [ ] No expert failures (experts not running)
- [ ] Databases backed up
- [ ] Reports exported for analysis
- [ ] Monitoring confirms stable operation
- [ ] Stakeholders notified

## Post-Rollback Analysis

After rollback, conduct root cause analysis:

### 1. Review Expert Performance

```bash
# Analyze expert telemetry
python scripts/analyze_moe_telemetry.py \
  --start "2026-02-15 00:00:00" \
  --end "2026-02-15 23:59:59"

# Look for:
# - Expert accuracy degradation patterns
# - Expert latency spikes
# - Expert failure patterns
# - Timeout patterns
```

### 2. Review Consensus Quality

```bash
# Analyze consensus decisions
python scripts/analyze_moe_consensus.py \
  --start "2026-02-15 00:00:00" \
  --end "2026-02-15 23:59:59"

# Look for:
# - Incorrect consensus decisions
# - High uncertainty rate
# - Split decisions (experts disagreeing)
# - Confidence score patterns
```

### 3. Review Expert Training

```bash
# Analyze training data
python scripts/analyze_moe_training.py

# Look for:
# - Accuracy trends over time
# - Threshold adjustment patterns
# - A/B test results
# - Model promotion history
```

### 4. Identify Root Cause

Common root causes:

#### Expert Accuracy Issues
- **Z3 Expert**: Proof complexity too high, timeout too short
- **Sentinel Expert**: Entropy threshold misconfigured, pattern database outdated
- **Guardian Expert**: Conservation checker integration issue, Merkle tree validation bug

#### Performance Issues
- **High Overhead**: Parallel execution bottleneck, telemetry collection overhead
- **Low Throughput**: Expert timeout too long, consensus engine slow
- **High Latency**: Gating network slow, cache not effective

#### Consensus Issues
- **High Uncertainty**: Confidence thresholds too high, experts disagreeing frequently
- **Incorrect Verdicts**: Consensus logic bug, expert weighting incorrect
- **High Fallback Rate**: Experts failing frequently, timeouts too aggressive

## Re-Deployment After Rollback

Once root cause is identified and fixed:

### 1. Fix Configuration

```bash
# Example: Adjust expert confidence thresholds
export AETHEL_Z3_EXPERT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75  # Was 0.7
export AETHEL_SENTINEL_EXPERT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75  # Was 0.7
export AETHEL_GUARDIAN_EXPERT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75  # Was 0.7

# Example: Increase expert timeouts
export AETHEL_Z3_EXPERT_TIMEOUT_NORMAL=40  # Was 30
export AETHEL_SENTINEL_EXPERT_TIMEOUT_MS=150  # Was 100
export AETHEL_GUARDIAN_EXPERT_TIMEOUT_MS=75  # Was 50

# Example: Adjust consensus thresholds
export AETHEL_CONSENSUS_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75  # Was 0.7
export AETHEL_CONSENSUS_UNCERTAINTY_THRESHOLD=0.6  # Was 0.5
```

### 2. Test in Staging

```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
python scripts/deploy_moe_shadow_mode.py --env staging

# Run for 24-48 hours
# Monitor metrics closely
# Verify fix resolves issue
```

### 3. Gradual Re-Deployment

```bash
# Phase 1: Shadow Mode (1-2 weeks)
python scripts/deploy_moe_shadow_mode.py

# Phase 2: Soft Launch (2-4 weeks)
python scripts/deploy_moe_soft_launch.py

# Phase 3: Full Activation
python scripts/deploy_moe_full_activation.py
```
