Property-Based Tests for Autonomous Sentinel Integration

This module tests the integration properties of the Autonomous Sentinel with
the existing Judge and defense layers.

Properties Tested:
- Property 44: Execution order invariant
- Property 45: Defense layer completeness
- Property 46: Rejection logging
