## 🎓 THE VALUE PROPOSITION

### The $1 Trillion Problem

**Financial systems lose billions because**:
- Software is based on "hope and test"
- Stop-loss orders fail during volatility
- Flash loan attacks drain protocols
- Insurance is expensive because risk is high

### The Aethel Solution

**Replace faith with mathematics**:
- Formal proof before execution
- Violations are mathematically impossible
- Insurance companies trust proofs
- Attacks literally cannot execute

### The Competitive Moat

**Not detection. Prevention.**:
- Traditional: "We hope it works"
- Aethel: "We prove it works"
- Traditional: "We detected the attack"
- Aethel: "The attack cannot execute"

---

### 6-Layer Defense System

1. **Layer -1**: Semantic Sanitizer (entropy analysis)
2. **Layer 0**: Input Sanitizer (injection prevention)
3. **Layer 1**: Conservation Checker (value preservation)
4. **Layer 2**: Overflow Guardian (bounds checking)
5. **Layer 3**: Z3 Theorem Prover (formal verification)
6. **Layer 4**: Autonomous Sentinel (anomaly detection)
