# Migration Guide: v1.7.0 → v1.8.0

**Aethel Synchrony Protocol Migration Guide**

---

## Overview

Aethel v1.8.0 introduces the **Synchrony Protocol** for parallel transaction processing. This guide helps you migrate from v1.7.0 and leverage the new capabilities.

**Good News**: v1.8.0 is **100% backward compatible**. Your existing code works without modification!

---

## What's New in v1.8.0

### 1. Parallel Transaction Processing
- Execute hundreds of transactions concurrently
- 10-20x throughput improvement
- Automatic dependency analysis

### 2. atomic_batch Syntax
- New keyword for batch execution
- All-or-nothing semantics
- Formal linearizability proofs

### 3. Enhanced Performance
- Multi-threaded execution (1-8 threads)
- Near-linear scalability
- Low latency overhead

---

## Backward Compatibility

### ✅ What Still Works

**All v1.7.0 code works without changes:**

```python
# v1.7.0 code (still works in v1.8.0)
from aethel.core.synchrony import Transaction
from aethel.core.batch_processor import BatchProcessor

tx = Transaction(
    id="tx1",
    intent_name="transfer",
    accounts={"alice": {"balance": 1000}, "bob": {"balance": 500}},
    operations=[],
    verify_conditions=[]
)

processor = BatchProcessor()
result = processor.execute_batch([tx])  # Works exactly as before
```

**API Contracts Preserved:**
- `Transaction` class unchanged
- `BatchResult` structure unchanged
- All error types unchanged
- All validation logic unchanged

### ✅ What's Enhanced

**Single transaction execution now uses BatchProcessor internally:**

```python
# New in v1.8.0 (but optional)
result = processor.execute_single_transaction(tx)

# Equivalent to:
result = processor.execute_batch([tx])
```

---

## Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Changes Needed

**If you're happy with current performance, do nothing!**

Your code continues to work exactly as before. The Synchrony Protocol is opt-in.

### Scenario 2: Add Parallel Execution

**If you want 10-20x speedup, use batches:**

#### Before (v1.7.0):
```python
# Execute transactions one by one
for tx in transactions:
    result = processor.execute_batch([tx])
    if not result.success:
        handle_error(result)
```

#### After (v1.8.0):
```python
# Execute all transactions in parallel
result = processor.execute_batch(transactions)
if not result.success:
    handle_error(result)
else:
    print(f"Throughput improvement: {result.throughput_improvement:.2f}x")
```

**Benefits:**
- 10-20x faster
- Same correctness guarantees
- Automatic dependency analysis
- Atomic commit/rollback

### Scenario 3: Use atomic_batch Syntax

**If you want declarative batch execution:**

#### Before (v1.7.0):
```python
# Programmatic transaction creation
transactions = []
for employee in employees:
    tx = Transaction(
        id=f"pay_{employee.id}",
        intent_name="transfer",
        accounts={
            "company": company_account,
            employee.id: employee_account
        },
        operations=[...],
        verify_conditions=[...]
    )
    transactions.append(tx)

result = processor.execute_batch(transactions)
```

#### After (v1.8.0):
```aethel
# Declarative atomic_batch
atomic_batch monthly_payroll {
    intent pay_employee_1(...) { ... }
    intent pay_employee_2(...) { ... }
    # ...
}
```

```python
# Parse and execute
parser = AethelParser()
ast = parser.parse(aethel_code)
result = processor.execute_atomic_batch(ast[0])
```

**Benefits:**
- More readable
- Easier to audit
- Automatic parallelization
- Built-in atomicity

## Performance Optimization

### When to Use Parallel Execution

✅ **Use parallel execution when:**
- You have 10+ independent transactions
- Transactions access different accounts
- Throughput is critical
- You can tolerate 15-25ms latency

❌ **Don't use parallel execution when:**
- You have < 10 transactions
- All transactions share the same account
- Latency is more critical than throughput
- You need deterministic execution order

### Optimal Configuration

```python
# Recommended settings
processor = BatchProcessor(
    num_threads=8,           # Use 4-8 threads
    timeout_seconds=300.0    # 5 minutes timeout
)

# Optimal batch size: 100-200 transactions
batch_size = 100
for i in range(0, len(transactions), batch_size):
    batch = transactions[i:i+batch_size]
    result = processor.execute_batch(batch)
```

## Common Migration Patterns

### Pattern 1: DeFi Exchange

#### Before:
```python
# Serial execution
for trade in trades:
    execute_trade(trade)
```

#### After:
```python
# Parallel execution
transactions = [create_trade_tx(t) for t in trades]
result = processor.execute_batch(transactions)
# 10x faster!
```

### Pattern 2: Payroll Processing

#### Before:
```python
# One by one
for employee in employees:
    pay_employee(employee)
```

#### After:
```python
# All at once
transactions = [create_payment_tx(e) for e in employees]
result = processor.execute_batch(transactions)
# 20x faster!
```

### Pattern 3: Batch Liquidations

#### Before:
```python
# Serial liquidations
for position in under_collateralized:
    liquidate(position)
```

#### After:
```python
# Parallel liquidations with oracle validation
transactions = [create_liquidation_tx(p) for p in under_collateralized]
result = processor.execute_batch(transactions)
# 10x faster + atomic!
```

## Error Handling

### v1.7.0 Error Handling (Still Works)

```python
result = processor.execute_batch(transactions)

if not result.success:
    print(f"Error: {result.error_message}")
    print(f"Type: {result.error_type}")
```

### v1.8.0 Enhanced Error Handling

```python
result = processor.execute_batch(transactions)

if not result.success:
    # Same as v1.7.0
    print(f"Error: {result.error_message}")
    
    # New in v1.8.0: Diagnostic info
    if result.diagnostic_info:
        if result.diagnostic_info.get('fallback'):
            print("Fell back to serial execution")
            print(f"Reason: {result.diagnostic_info['reason']}")
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Performance Not Improved

**Symptom**: `throughput_improvement < 2.0x`

**Diagnosis**:
```python
result = processor.execute_batch(transactions)
print(f"Conflicts: {len(result.conflicts_detected)}")
print(f"Parallelism: {result.avg_parallelism}")
```

**Solutions**:
- Reduce shared account usage
- Increase batch size
- Check for unnecessary dependencies

### Issue: Linearizability Proof Fails

**Symptom**: `error_type: LinearizabilityError`

**Diagnosis**:
```python
if result.diagnostic_info.get('fallback'):
    print("System fell back to serial execution")
    print(f"Reason: {result.diagnostic_info['reason']}")
```

**Solutions**:
- System automatically falls back to serial
- No action needed (correctness preserved)
- Consider simplifying dependencies

### Issue: Conservation Violation

**Symptom**: `error_type: ConservationViolationError`

**Diagnosis**:
```python
print(f"Expected: {result.diagnostic_info['expected_total']}")
print(f"Actual: {result.diagnostic_info['actual_total']}")
print(f"Violation: {result.diagnostic_info['violation_amount']}")
```

**Solutions**:
- Check transaction arithmetic
- Verify all account updates
- Validate oracle proofs

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small

```python
# Start with small batches
batch_size = 10
result = processor.execute_batch(transactions[:batch_size])

# Gradually increase
if result.success and result.throughput_improvement > 2.0:
    batch_size = 100
```

### 2. Monitor Performance

```python
# Track metrics
metrics = {
    'throughput_improvement': result.throughput_improvement,
    'avg_parallelism': result.avg_parallelism,
    'execution_time': result.execution_time
}

# Alert if performance degrades
if metrics['throughput_improvement'] < 2.0:
    alert("Performance degradation detected")
```

### 3. Use Appropriate Thread Count

```python
import os

# Use CPU count
num_threads = min(os.cpu_count(), 8)
processor = BatchProcessor(num_threads=num_threads)
```

### 4. Handle Errors Gracefully

```python
try:
    result = processor.execute_batch(transactions)
    if not result.success:
        # Log error
        logger.error(f"Batch failed: {result.error_message}")
        # Retry with smaller batch
        retry_with_smaller_batch(transactions)
except Exception as e:
    # Unexpected error
    logger.exception("Unexpected error in batch execution")
    # Fall back to serial
    execute_serial(transactions)
```
