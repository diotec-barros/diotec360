Traditional crop insurance:
  ❌ Manual claims processing (weeks/months)
  ❌ Subjective damage assessment
  ❌ High fraud rates (10-30%)
  ❌ Expensive overhead (40% of premiums)
  ❌ Disputes and litigation

Aethel Parametric Insurance:
  ✅ Instant automated payouts (seconds)
  ✅ Objective data-driven triggers (rainfall, temperature)
  ✅ Zero fraud (mathematically impossible)
  ✅ Minimal overhead (< 5% of premiums)
  ✅ No disputes (math is the arbiter)

💰 COMMERCIAL VALUE:
  - Insurance companies: 40% cost reduction
  - Farmers: Instant liquidity in crisis
  - Governments: Efficient disaster relief
  - Global market: $10B+ opportunity

🌍 REAL-WORLD IMPACT:
  - 500M+ smallholder farmers globally
  - 90% uninsured due to high costs
  - Aethel makes insurance accessible and affordable
