# DIOTEC 360 IA - The Sovereign Judge

**The first mathematically proved sovereign AI infrastructure.**

Developed by **Kiro** for **Dionísio Sebastião Barros**.

## 🏛️ Architecture

DIOTEC 360 IA is a sovereign artificial intelligence system that combines:

- **Z3 Theorem Prover** - Mathematical verification of all operations
- **Intent-Based Programming** - Natural language to formal logic
- **Conservation Laws** - Cryptographic proof of state integrity
- **Distributed Consensus** - Byzantine fault-tolerant architecture

## 🚀 Features

- ⚖️ **Mathematical Proofs** - Every transaction is formally verified
- 🔒 **Cryptographic Security** - ED25519 signatures on all operations
- 🌐 **Distributed State** - Merkle tree-based state management
- 🧠 **AI-Powered** - Intent parsing and semantic analysis
- 📊 **Real-time Monitoring** - Complete observability and audit trails

## 📡 API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Health check and system status
- `POST /verify` - Verify intent logic with Z3
- `POST /parse` - Parse intent code to AST
- `GET /state` - Get current state root
- `GET /metrics` - System metrics and statistics
