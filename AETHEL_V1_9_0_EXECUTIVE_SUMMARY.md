## 💎 WHAT IS AETHEL?

**Aethel replaces "probably correct" with "provably correct."**

Traditional software operates on faith:
- Faith that programmers didn't make mistakes
- Faith that tests caught all bugs
- Faith that systems won't fail

**Aethel operates on mathematical facts:**
- Every line of code proven by Z3 theorem prover
- Every transaction defended by autonomous systems
- Every AI output verified before execution

**Result**: Software that is impossible to hack, impossible to exploit, impossible to fail.
