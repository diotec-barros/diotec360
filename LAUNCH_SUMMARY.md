## 🌟 Key Messages

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"Aethel is the first programming language where bugs are mathematically impossible. It combines formal verification with AI code generation to create correct-by-construction software. We've demonstrated it with a satellite controller and financial system - both mathematically proved."

### Technical Pitch (2 minutes)
"Aethel integrates Z3 SMT Solver directly into the compilation process. Developers write INTENT (what should be true) instead of implementation. The Judge proves it mathematically. If proof fails, compilation is blocked. If proof succeeds, AI generates implementation. Code is stored in content-addressable vault. This would have prevented $2.1B+ in DeFi hacks."

### Value Proposition
"Stop testing. Start proving. Make bugs mathematically impossible."
